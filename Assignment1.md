## Assignment 1: computing gene length and %GC content distributions

Using the provided *Sinorhizobium meliloti* data in this repository (see `README.md` for a description of the data files), write code to calculate the length and %GC content of each gene in the genome.
Create a scatter plot with gene length on the X axis and gene %GC content on the Y axis.

### Some comments

- You are welcome to discuss the assignment with your classmates, instructors, friends, enemies, neighbors, and the internet.
  However, you cannot copy code from anywhere or anyone: *you must write your own code!*
  The one exception is that you may copy from class notes.
- Python is the preferred language and the IPython/Jupyter notebook is the preferred coding environment.
  If you have a good or compelling reason to use a different language or environment, that's ok but please discuss submission specifics with the instructor.
- We will be distributing more details via OnCourse, but assume that you will need to have your assignment ready for assessment by Mon Sept 7th.
  It will be simplest if you have a GitHub repository with an IPython notebook you can point us to, and cloning this repository is probably the way to go.
