## Assignment 1: computing gene length and %GC content distributions

Using the provided *Sinorhizobium meliloti* data in this repository (see `README.md` for a description of the data files), write code to calculate the length and %GC content of each gene in the genome.
Create a scatter plot with gene length on the X axis and gene %GC content on the Y axis.
Deposit your solution (code and output, preferrably in the form of an IPython notebook) in a public GitHub repository for review by the instructor(s).

### Some comments

- You are welcome to discuss the assignment with your classmates, instructors, friends, enemies, neighbors, and the internet.
  However, you cannot copy code from anywhere or anyone: *you must write your own code!*
  The one exception is that you may copy from class notes.
- Python is the preferred language and the IPython/Jupyter notebook is the preferred coding environment.
  If you have a good or compelling reason to use a different language or environment, that's probably ok but please discuss submission specifics with the instructor.
- Please have your assignment ready for assessment by Monday September 7th.
  Keep in mind that Monday is a holiday, and if you have plans for the long weekend, plan accordingly: it would be better to complete the assignment early than to ruin the holiday because you managed your time poorly!
